Super Alarm Project - should wake you up 100%
Implemented:
-interface ✓
-way to set a normal alarm ✓
-way to set a Super alarm(using a hardcoded password)✓
-implemented the room database, now i need to make use of it ✓
-use DB to store names, ages and passwords, and also use it to create a list of alarms and preferences tab
-implement a puzzle instead of a password
-connect the app to a smartwatch to read your bpm

Also i need to buy an Android phone because the emulator is very limiting.
